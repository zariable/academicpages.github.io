I am an experienced technical leader with expertise in machine learning and I have a passion for applying machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques to help solve real-world problems.


Jun Yu holds a Ph.D. in computer science from Oregon State University and has more than 10 years of experience in developing machine-learning algorithms and applying machine-learning techniques to solve large-scale, real-world problems.


He works as a senior applied scientist and tech lead at Amazon, where he leads a team of scientists and engineers to forecast sales velocity for various Amazon promotions, generate promotion recommendations for sellers and optimize deal scheduling to maximize customer satisfaction.

Before joining Amazon, he was a MTS applied researcher at eBay, building machine-learning solutions for eBay's internet marketing on Google and Facebook. He optimized the bidding strategies in online ad auctions and provided personalized recommendations to various marketing channels.

I received my Ph.D in [Computer Science]{http://eecs.oregonstate.edu/} from [Oregon State University]{https://oregonstate.edu/} working under the guidance of [Dr. Weng-Keen Wong]{http://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~wongwe/}. During my Ph.D. study, his research focused on using probabilistic graphical models to predict species distribution with citizen science data and quantify the skill level of citizen scientists in the [eBird project]{https://ebird.org/home}.

Create content & metadata
------
For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).
