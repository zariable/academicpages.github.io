Experience
======
* Amazon - Senior Applied Scientist and Tech Lead [2017 - Now]
  * _Promotion_ Lead a team of applied scientists to forecast sale velocity for various Amazon deals, generate promotion recommendations for sellers and vendors and optimize the deal scheduling to maximize customer satisfaction. We build large-scale demand forecasting models on Spark and a ML inference platform to surface model predictions in real time.

* eBay - Applied Science Tech Lead [2013 - 2017]
  * _Marketing_ Led a team of 8 applied researchers to power eBayâ€™s paid internet marketing by improving the bidding strategies on Google and Facebook to maximize ROI. Our models improved the ROI by 27% in 2016, leading to millions more GMB annually.
  * _Trust_ Built a large-scale machine learning model to predict seller risk and reduce the number of defective transactions on eBay via search ranking demotion, which translates to 100+ million GMB lift annually.
  * _Search_ Implemented a topic model based approach to retrieve diverse items based on user buying intents and improved the user satisfaction by 6+%.

* Oregon State University - PhD Researcher [2006 - 2013]
  * Developed probabilistic graphical models to predict species distribution with citizen science data, which significantly improved the accuracy of species distribution.
  * Developed a generative mixture model in the eBird human/computer learning network to quantify the skill level of citizen scientists in the eBird project.

Education
======
* Ph.D. in Computer Science, Oregon State University [2006 - 2013]
* B.S. in Computer Science, Wuhan University, China [2002 - 2006]

Skills
======
* _Python and R_ for training machine learning models, data analytics and rapid prototyping.
* _Scala and Java_  for building and deploying end-to-end application in production.
* _Spark and Scalding_ for building ML pipelines and training larges-scale ML models.
* _SQL_ for ad-hoc queries on RDBMS
